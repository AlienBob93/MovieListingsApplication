Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family. This app to allows users to discover the most popular movies playing.

The application uses [The MovieDB APIs](https://developers.themoviedb.org/4/getting-started) to pull movie details and display them in a list that can be sorted according to user preference.
The application also allows marking favorites, that list is stored in a local database that allows for easy viewing offline.
